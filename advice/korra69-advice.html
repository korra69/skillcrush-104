			<h4>What I know for sure:</h4>
			<p>Coding is a journey. Keep moving and learning. New delights await just down the road beyond every forest of confusion.</p> 
			
			<p>It pays to be patient and persevere. Especially if tech is new to you. If you believe you will find the answer, with the right amount of searching and trying different solutions, eventually you will find the answer.</p>

			<p>Ask questions and read as many resources as you can. Many have done this before and there is a lot of knowledge already out there that can help you find the answers you seek. Keep going. Clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Coding is like music that sings back to you once written.</h4>
			<p>The languages will respond to you as you code. The messages they send are a key and a guide to help you understand. Read carefully and take heed.</p>

			<p>Cultivate carefulness. Code is sensitive to mistakes. Develop early the habit of proofreading.</p>

			<p>Take breaks when you need them and try to work when you are refreshed. When your mind is most open and clear. Understanding comes more readily in these moments.</p
